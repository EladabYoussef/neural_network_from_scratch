# Machine Learning Architecture Exploration

## Introduction
This project provides a comprehensive framework for experimenting with machine learning architectures, specifically neural networks and logistic regression models. The primary goal is to test and evaluate various architectures and their performance on the MNIST dataset. The project is built from scratch with an object-oriented approach to facilitate easy experimentation and analysis of different model architectures.

## Features
- **Object-Oriented Neural Network Implementation:**
  - **Architecture:** A custom-built neural network using classes to define layers, activation functions, and optimization algorithms.
  - **Components:** Includes classes for layers (e.g., Dense, Activation), activation functions (e.g., ReLU, Sigmoid), and optimizers (e.g., Gradient Descent).
  - **Training and Evaluation:** Methods for training the network with forward and backward propagation, and evaluating performance using accuracy and loss metrics.

- **Logistic Regression Model:**
  - **Implementation:** Provides a logistic regression model built from scratch with classes for prediction, cost computation, and optimization.
  - **Evaluation Metrics:** Includes functionality to compute accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

- **Experimentation Framework:**
  - **Architecture Testing:** Easily swap and test different neural network architectures and logistic regression configurations.
  - **Performance Comparison:** Evaluate and compare the performance of various models using visualizations and metrics.
- **Parameters saving**: i saved the parameters of the model after training in a text file named "params.txt" using json.

## Installation
To set up the project and start experimenting with the models, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:**
2. **download the dataset from here:** https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/oddrationale/mnist-in-csv
3. **create a directory named datasets in your project directory and put the datasets in it**
